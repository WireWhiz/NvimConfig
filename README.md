# Windows Setup

Install a good terminal emulator such as [alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty)
Install a good font for it from [nerdfonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads)
Use the alacritty config that I'll totally remember to put somewhere in here

cd %LOCALAPPDATA%
git clone <REPOLINK> nvim
```
